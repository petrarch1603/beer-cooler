**Beer Cooler Project**

This is a project to build an interactive website to keep track of beers in a cooler.

Uses Vue.js to create a template of beers. Currently the data object is stored in main.js.
Vue 2.5.16

#Style
Bootstrap 4.0 CSS
Uses a blue/white palette to simulate an old Coleman Cooler. Wood panel background gives the app a summer picnic feel.

#TODO
* Add function to add beers to the cooler.
* Interface the object data to a [beer REST API](http://beer.fluentcloud.com/v1/beer)
* Add icons for the beers that logically connect the beer logo to the beer type, defaulting to a generic beer.
* Add column headers
* Styling options, find complementary fonts, minor tweaks.
